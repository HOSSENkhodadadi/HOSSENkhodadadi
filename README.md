## Projects
Here are some of the projects I've been working on:

1. [Leveraging Personal Pronoun Resolution, Keywords Extraction, Data Augmentation, and Model Exploration for Enhanced Abstractive Dialogue Summarization(NLP, Deep
Learning)]([https://github.com/HOSSENkhodadadi/Projects/tree/main/caltech_classification_fine_tuning_alexNet](https://github.com/HOSSENkhodadadi/SICK_Summarization)): Multiple Seq2Seq models were trained and improved through augmentation to evaluate their capabilities for dialogue summarization task.
Tech: Hugging Face, Weights\&Biasses, 

2. [Caltech Classification and Fine Tuning on AlexNet (Classification, Deep
Learning)](https://github.com/HOSSENkhodadadi/Projects/tree/main/caltech_classification_fine_tuning_alexNet): AlexNet model was used to predict in low data regimes and a large number of classes. different fine-tuning techniques were used to improve the accuracy.
Tech: Weights\&Biasses, Pytorch

3. [A Novel Approach for Improving Generalization in Federated Learning Through Corrective Gradient Weights (Federated Learning, Deep Learning)](https://github.com/HOSSENkhodadadi/Projects/tree/main/A%20Novel%20Approach%20for%20Improving%20Generalization%20in%20Federated): The Federated Learning paradigm was implemented to train a central Neural Network Model without intruding the clients privacy, the model improved by adding the Corrective Gradient Weights.
    Tech: Python, PyTorch

4. [Reinforcement Learning on Game Agent Training for Quixo Board Game (RL, Deep RL)](https://github.com/HOSSENkhodadadi/Computational_Intelligence/tree/main/Final%20Project%20(Quixo)): Min-Max algorithm was implemented to play Quixo game with 95% win rate against a random player.
Tech: Python, Pytorch

5. [Audio Intent Detection (Classification, Deep Learning)](https://github.com/HOSSENkhodadadi/Projects/tree/main/Intent%20Detection%20on%20the%20Fluent%20Speech%20Commands): A deep learning model was designed to classify audio files using MFCC method. Tech: Python, TensorFlow, Keras 


5. [Predicting Covid-19 outbreak using LSTM algorithm in Deep Learning (Time Series Prediction, Deep
Learning)](https://github.com/HOSSENkhodadadi/Bachelors-Thesis): A deep learning model was designed to predict the number of contaminated, recovered and death covid cases.
Tech: Python, TensorFlow, Keras

Feel free to explore and contribute!
